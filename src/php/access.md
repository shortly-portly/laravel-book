# Access Control
In PHP, the access control keywords for class members (properties and methods) are:

1. **Private:** Declaring a class member as `private` restricts its visibility to within the class where it is defined. It cannot be accessed or modified from outside the class, including subclasses. Private members are used to encapsulate implementation details and prevent direct external access.

   ```php
   class MyClass {
       private $privateProperty;
       
       private function privateMethod() {
           // Implementation
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Protected:** Declaring a class member as `protected` allows access within the class where it is defined and within its subclasses (inheritance). Protected members are not directly accessible from outside the class hierarchy. They are used to provide access to subclasses while still maintaining encapsulation.

   ```php
   class ParentClass {
       protected $protectedProperty;
       
       protected function protectedMethod() {
           // Implementation
       }
   }

   class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
       // Access to protectedProperty and protectedMethod here
   }
   ```

3. **Public:** Declaring a class member as `public` makes it accessible from anywhere, both within the class and from external code. Public members are used for properties and methods that are meant to be part of the class's public interface.

   ```php
   class PublicClass {
       public $publicProperty;
       
       public function publicMethod() {
           // Implementation
       }
   }
   ```

The differences between these access control keywords are based on their visibility and accessibility:

- `private`: Members are only accessible within the class that defines them.
- `protected`: Members are accessible within the class and its subclasses (inheritance).
- `public`: Members are accessible from anywhere, including external code.

Choosing the appropriate access level for class members depends on the desired level of encapsulation and how you want to expose or restrict access to the internals of your class. It's a key aspect of designing well-structured and maintainable object-oriented code.
