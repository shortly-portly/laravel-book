# Public Static Function
The difference between `public static function` and `public function` lies in how they are accessed, their behavior, and the context in which they are used within a class in PHP.

**Public Static Function:**
A `public static function` is a method that belongs to the class itself rather than to an instance of the class. This means you can call the method using the class name, without needing to create an instance of the class. Static methods are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed globally.

Example:
```php
class MyClass {
    public static function staticMethod() {
        // Static method implementation
    }
}

// Call the static method using the class name
MyClass::staticMethod();
```

**Public Function:**
A `public function` is a method that belongs to an instance of the class. It can only be called on an object (an instance) of the class, not on the class itself. Each instance of the class has its own copy of non-static methods.

Example:
```php
class MyClass {
    public function instanceMethod() {
        // Instance method implementation
    }
}

// Create an instance of the class
$object = new MyClass();

// Call the instance method on the object
$object->instanceMethod();
```

**Key Differences:**
1. **Access:**
   - Public Static Function: Can be accessed using the class name (e.g., `MyClass::staticMethod()`).
   - Public Function: Can only be accessed on an object of the class (e.g., `$object->instanceMethod()`).

2. **Usage:**
   - Public Static Function: Used for utility methods that don't require access to instance-specific data.
   - Public Function: Used for methods that operate on instance-specific data.

3. **Instance Dependency:**
   - Public Static Function: Doesn't have access to instance-specific data since it doesn't belong to a specific instance.
   - Public Function: Can access and manipulate instance-specific data.

In summary, use `public static function` for methods that are related to the class as a whole and don't need access to instance-specific data. Use `public function` for methods that work with instance-specific data and require an object to operate on.
