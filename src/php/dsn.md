# DSN
DSN stands for "Data Source Name." It is a string format used to specify the connection details and parameters required to connect to a database or other data source. DSNs are commonly used in various programming languages and frameworks to provide a standardized way of describing how to establish a connection to a data store, such as a database server.

A DSN typically includes information such as:

1. **Driver or Protocol:** Specifies the type of database or data source you're connecting to. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, ODBC, etc.

2. **Hostname or IP Address:** The address of the server where the database is located.

3. **Port:** The port number to connect to on the server. This is optional and often uses default values (e.g., 3306 for MySQL).

4. **Database Name:** The name of the specific database you want to connect to.

5. **Username and Password:** The credentials required to authenticate and access the database.

Here's a generic format of a DSN:

```
driver:host=hostname;port=port;dbname=database_name
```

For example, a DSN for connecting to a MySQL database might look like:

```
mysql:host=localhost;port=3306;dbname=mydatabase
```

DSNs are used in various contexts, such as when configuring database connections in web applications, connecting to databases using programming languages like PHP, Python, and Java, or setting up data source connections in tools like ODBC or JDBC.

Using DSNs helps centralize and standardize connection details, making it easier to manage and modify database connections without having to modify code throughout your application.
